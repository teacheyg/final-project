            <h2>We Want Our Bodies Back</h2>
            <h4>Jessica Care Moore</h4>
        </article>
        <p class="para">Over the past two decades, jessica Care moore has become a cultural force as a poet, performer, publisher, activist, and critic. Reflecting her transcendent electric voice, this searing poetry collection is filled with moving, original stanzas that speak to both Black women's creative and intellectual power, and express the pain, sadness, and anger of those who suffer constant scrutiny because of their gender and race. Fierce and passionate, Jessica Care moore argues that Black women spend their lives building a physical and emotional shelter to protect themselves from misogyny, criminalization, hatred, stereotypes, sexual assault, objectification, patriarchy, and death threats</p>

            <h4> Review</h4>
        </article>
        <p class="para">This book is one of many that Black women of all ages need to have on their shelf. It showcases how our bodies are often overly sexualized and misconcepted by people in the world. The most important thing is that it teaches us how to love our bodies and how not to fall into what the media portrays.</p>
        <p class="pr"> I would give this book 5/5 stars. It is very empowering and uplifting.</p>
