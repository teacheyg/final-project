            <h4>Scarlett St. Clair</h4>
        </article>
        <p class="para">Isolde, newly coronated queen, has finally found a king worthy of her in the vampire Adrian. But their love for each other has cost Isolde her father and her homeland. With two opposing goddesses playing mortals and vampires like chess pieces against one another, Isolde is uncertain who her allies are in the vampire stronghold of Revekka.</p>
        <p class="para">Now, as politics in the Red Palace grow more underhanded and a deadly blood mist threatens all of Cordova, Isolde must trust in the bond she's formed with Adrian, even as she learns troubling information about his complicated past.</p>

            <h4> Review</h4>
        </article>
        <p class="para">Now my mother taught me that if I don't have anything nice to say then don't it at all, but I'm hard-headed. This book was not the best, it is apart of a hopefully, 3 book series due to the Mount Everest of a cliffhanger that it was left off on. I read the previous book and this one in one night just to be disappointed.</p>
        <p class="pr"> I would give this book 2.5/5 stars. I would reccomend just reading the first book and waiting for the third one to be announced to read this one.</p>
