            <h2>The Rebel King</h2>
            <h4>Kennedy Ryan</h4>

        <p class="para">Though surrender is what Maxim Cade demanded of Lennix Hunter's body and heart, she had other plans. They were fast-burning fascination and combustible chemistry, the son of an oil baron and the Apache daughter at war with his family, but she trusted him, and he turned out to be a thief who stole her love.</p>
        <p class="para">Still, if what they had was a lie, why had it felt so real?</p>   
        <p class="para">Now, the man she swore to hate is about to have it all, and he wants Lennix at his side. But when the two of them are forced to face the unthinkable, their rocky foundation is tested, as is the invisible thread that seems to wind their fates together. As they navigate a treacherous political landscape in their quest for justice, Maxim and Lennix soon learn that power is a game, and they are merely the pawns and players. Facing insurmountable odds, will they win the world, or will they lose it all?</p>

            <h4> Review</h4>
        </article>
        <p class="para">This series is great for romantics that enjoys a strong willed female main character and an even stronger male main character. This book has a great sense of passion, intellect, and firecness in terms of standing up for what you believe in and stand for. </p>
        <p class="pr"> I would give this book 5/5 stars.</p>
