        <p class="para">Kell is one of the last Antari—magicians with a rare, coveted ability to travel between parallel Londons; Red, Grey, White, and, once upon a time, Black. Kell was raised in Arnes—Red London—and officially serves the Maresh Empire as an ambassador, traveling between the frequent bloody regime changes in White London and the court of George III in the dullest of Londons, the one without any magic left to see.</p>

        </article>
        <p class="para">Unfortunatley I was not able to finish this book. I heard many good reviews about the series and thought that maybe this is my gateway to sci-fi. Least to say, it was not.  </p>
        <p class="para"> I would give this book 2/5 stars. I see the poteintal, but maybe I need to force myself to get into the mindset to read this series.</p>
